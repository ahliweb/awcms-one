/**
 * Automated accessibility smoke — `@axe-core/playwright` over representative
 * admin routes changed by epic #858, in both themes and at two viewports.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * #858's acceptance criteria required "no critical/serious
 * `@axe-core/playwright` findings" on every route its waves touched
 * (`.admin-status-pill`, `.admin-timeline`, `.admin-stat-card`, the shared
 * media/comments primitives, the ADR-0125 dialogs), but no axe harness ever
 * existed under `tests/e2e/` — the criterion could not be measured while
 * waves 1–7 landed (reported honestly in PR #876). This spec is that harness
 * (Issue #877, epic #858).
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * Eight representative routes: the dashboard, a moderation queue
 * (`.admin-bulk-bar` + confirm dialog), a `.admin-status-pill` list screen
 * (`/admin/users`), a `.admin-timeline` screen (`/admin/approvals`), the
 * media grid (`ReasonPanel` delete), the OMES control-center index, one OMES
 * detail screen (`/admin/omes/jobs`), and a settings screen with the
 * `SettingsSaveBar` (`/admin/site-profile`). Each is scanned in light AND
 * dark theme, at 360px (narrowest real phone width, matching
 * `responsive-360.e2e.ts`) and desktop (the `read` project's native
 * 1280x720), against the WCAG 2.0 A/AA and 2.1 A/AA rule sets. A run fails on
 * any `critical`/`serious` violation; `moderate`/`minor` are informational
 * only (axe itself, not this repo, decides what belongs in which bucket).
 *
 * `ConfirmDialog` and `ReasonPanel` (ADR-0125) are scanned separately, each
 * OPENED THROUGH A REAL BUTTON on a page where doing so performs no
 * mutation: `/admin/offices`' delete button for the confirm dialog (the
 * seeded head office row always exists — the same fixture
 * `admin-offices.e2e.ts` relies on) and `/admin/modules`' disable button for
 * the reason panel (a non-core module is enabled by default in every fresh
 * tenant). Both are cancelled rather than submitted, so this spec never
 * performs a mutation through the app — required by its READ_WAVE
 * classification (`support/e2e-read-wave.ts` fails the test otherwise). A
 * moderation-queue confirm dialog would have needed seeded comment rows this
 * spec does not create; the offices/modules pair needs no fixture at all.
 *
 * ## Theme switching: the app's real mechanism, not a stub
 *
 * `src/lib/security/theme-init-script.ts` resolves the active theme from
 * `localStorage["awcms_theme"]` on every page load (an inline, CSP-hashed
 * script that runs before first paint). This spec sets that same key through
 * `page.evaluate` after establishing the app's origin with one navigation,
 * then reloads — the identical mechanism a real operator's click on
 * `ThemeToggle.astro` drives (`src/lib/ui/theme-toggle-client.ts` writes the
 * same key). No CSS override, no `prefers-color-scheme` emulation standing in
 * for the real switch.
 *
 * ## Why READ_WAVE
 *
 * Every scan is a `page.goto` plus, for the two dialog cases, opening and
 * then CANCELLING a dialog. Nothing here changes tenant state through the
 * app, so it belongs beside `responsive-360.e2e.ts` and the other read-only
 * sweeps rather than in WRITE_WAVE — see `tests/e2e/support/e2e-waves.ts`.
